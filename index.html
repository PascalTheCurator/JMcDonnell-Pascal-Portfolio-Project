of divs - in this case, the "img_left" class will style all the images I want to align to the left

    <p><h3>A Poem By A Non-Poet</h3></br>Based on a text I sent to my father after returning home from a short vacation,  
    this poem somehow ended up in a pretty dark place thanks to a large amount of song lyrics.  
    I'm happy with it at the end of the day because despite being rather averse to poetry it still ended up having meaning,  
    despite also being made of random lines from random web pages.  
    Some of the images are probably still broken, but I'm far too inexperienced to know why.  
    Although I feel like that's something that could be said with 1 year or 20 years of coding experience.

    <p><h3>A Video By A Non-Videographer</h3></br>The first project I went off the rails for, which was a sign of what's to come.  
    What was meant to be a looping Zoom background turned into more of a 1 minute performance.  
    Call it a lack of other ideas, or a spark of genius. I'll just call it a completed project personally.

    <p><h3>A Story By A Non-Author</h3></br>An adaptation of a story I had previously written with some friends years ago,  
  although limited to only the first page or so.  
  As it turns out it's very hard to turn over 6 pages of a linear story into a choose your own adventure if you're already bad at writing.  
  It did definitely help that there's a lot of solid break points in the story.  
  This is like a teaser, it'll get you interested in a project that'll never happen.</p>

    <p><h3>A Website By A Non-Web-Dev</h3></br>I really wish I wasn't using the template for this,  
    but I think at the end of the day a decent looking page that hits all the requirements is a good enough starting point.  
    There's basically no chance I learn how to do all this on my own, so I'm better off trying to learn what I can from what's already here,  
    and then maybe I'll come back and turn it into an actual portfolio that could land me a job.  
    Or maybe not. You never really know, do you?

    <p><h3>INTO DARK / FROM LIGHt</h3></br>My two most recent songs, although one was made almost 8 months ago. 
      Super proud of both, also tried a different style of cover art, and I think it's something I can work on more in the future.
      There's clearly plenty of room to grow.

  <div class="text_left">
    <p><h3>FARSIGHT / STARGAZING</h3></br>Farsight is a track from earlier this year that I was very happy with when I made it.
    It's very different than what I'm used to making, which kinda fits this class in a way.
    Stargazing is from a full year ago now, it's my only EP on this alias, and I still think it's probably my best work.
    Hopefully I can make something better soon.
